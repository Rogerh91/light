Summary

Light is an open-source search engine that seeks to curate all learning resources across the web, and make them accessible in an intuitive fashion that allows for an easy progression of learning. 

Business Model 

Light will sustain and scale itself on a social enterprise model that seeks to monetize by using community contributions, crowdfunding on Indiegogo, and advertising opportunities for organizations trying to push their ever-green content marketing to new audiences. Ultimately, the end goal is to be able to translate all of these learning resources across multiple languages, and render the data in a mobile-friendly version similar to Wikipedia Zero. For this to occur, professional, co-branding partners will have to pay for the translations, and whatever other money is required will be provided either by crowdfunding page-by-page, or through drawing from a general tip jar. 

Curation Details

Light will curate content according to learning category, and difficulty. The categories of resources will be subdivided into seven types: blog posts, videos, podcasts, courses, formal papers, games, and “answers” sourced from StackOverflow, Quora, and other Q & A sites. These will be further divided into the three main categories: visual learning (blog posts, videos, courses, formal papers, and answers), auditory learning (videos, courses, and podcasts), and kinetic learning (games, answers, and courses).


Technical Details 

Light will use HTML 5/CSS 3 and JQuery for display elements on the front-end. The back-end will be composed of a NoSQL patch in to PHP that will push GET requests to the appropriately tagged information.
