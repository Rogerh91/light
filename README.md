<b>Summary</b>

Light is an open-source search engine that seeks to curate all learning resources across the web, and make them accessible in an intuitive fashion that allows for an easy progression of learning. 

<b>Business Model</b>

Light will sustain and scale itself on a social enterprise model that seeks to monetize by using community contributions, crowdfunding on Indiegogo, and advertising opportunities for organizations trying to push their ever-green content marketing to new audiences. Ultimately, the end goal is to be able to translate all of these learning resources across multiple languages, and render the data in a mobile-friendly version similar to Wikipedia Zero. For this to occur, professional, co-branding partners will have to pay for the translations, and whatever other money is required will be provided either by crowdfunding page-by-page, or through drawing from a general tip jar. 

<b>Curation Details</b>

Light will curate content according to learning category, and difficulty. The categories of resources will be subdivided into seven types: blog posts, videos, podcasts, courses, formal papers, games, and “answers” sourced from StackOverflow, Quora, and other Q & A sites. These will be further divided into the three main categories: visual learning (blog posts, videos, courses, formal papers, and answers), auditory learning (videos, courses, and podcasts), and kinetic learning (games, answers, and courses).


<b>Technical Details</b>

Light will use HTML 5/CSS 3 and JQuery for display elements on the front-end. The back-end will be composed of a NoSQL patch in to PHP that will push GET requests to the appropriately tagged information.
